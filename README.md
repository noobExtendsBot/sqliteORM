# Field types and Relationships

## Fields Supported

    "CharField"
    "TextField" [Need to complete the tests]
    "AutoField"
    "IntegerField" [not implemented yet]
    "DecimalField" [not implemented yet]
    "FloatField" [not implemented yet]
    "DateTimeField" [not implemented yet]
    "BooleanField" [not implemented yet]
    "ImageField" [not implemented yet]
    "FileField" [not implemented yet]

## Relationship supported

### Primary Key

1. Each Table with Only one PK (primary_key = True)

2. Supoorts multiple unqiue constrainsts in a table (unique=True)

3. Does not support composite primary key

4. Can not use Primary key and unique set to True at the same time.

### Foreign Key

1. Does not support Polymorphic association (multiple FK in a single table)

2. Supports Recursive Relationship [not implemented yet]

### One To One

1. Supports 1:1

### ManyToMany

1. Supports M:N

## Folder Layout

1. docs/ - contains docs generated by Sphinx
2. orm/ - changed it to single file `orm.py` has all the code and `example.py` shows an example of what has been implemented until now.
3. tests/ - It has tests for `orm.py` files.

NOTE: You can read more about implementation in the `docs/_build/html/index.html`  
Also, docs and new implementation might not match if I forgot to re-generate it.

## How it's supposed to be used

```
class User(Model):
	# if you don't specify class name will be used
	_table = "user"
	name = CharField(primary_key=True, max_length=10)
	bio = TextField()
	age = IntegerField()

migration = MigrationManager([User, Blog])
migration.apply()

u = User(name="John", bio="some random text", age=10)
u.save()
u.objects.get(name="john")
```
